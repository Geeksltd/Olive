# Olive: Dev Commands
Olive provides a mechanism to invoke commands on a running application, to help with testing, debugging and diagnostics.

There are a number of such commands built into the Olive framework and several of its plugins, but you can create your own also.

When your application is running under the `Development` environment *(e.g. via LaunchSettings.json)*, these commands will become invocable.
But they are ignored if the application is running under any other environment such as `Staging` or `Production`.

## Creating a Dev Command
To create a dev command, all you need to do is to create a class that implements `Olive.IDevCommand` and register it in the standard ASP.NET Dependency Injection framework.

The `IDevCommand` interface has the following members:

```csharp
// A command that can be sent to the application during development time.
public interface IDevCommand
{
    // Programmatic name of the command.
    string Name { get; }
    
    // A text or title for this command (optional). If set, it will be shown to the developer on the UI.
    string Title { get; }

    // Determines whether this command is usable in the current context and configuration.
    bool IsEnabled();
     
    // Invokes the command. After the command execution, if it returns null or empty,
    // the user will be redirected to the http url referrer, or the root of the application.
    // Otherwise, the returned string value will be rendered in the http response.     
    Task<string> Run();    
}
```

### Example

The following example shows a simple command implementation to invoke `Database.Refresh()`

```csharp
class DatabaseClearCacheDevCommand : IDevCommand
{
    IDatabase Database;
    public DatabaseClearCacheDevCommand(IDatabase database) => Database = database;
    
    public string Name => "db-clear-cache";
    public string Title => "Clear DB cache";
    public bool IsEnabled() => true;

    public async Task<string> Run()
    {
        await Database.Refresh();
        return null;
    }
}
```
In order for this command to be recognised, it should be registered as a service. For example you can add the following in your `Startup.cs` file under `ConfigureServices`:
```cshrap
services.AddSingleton<IDevCommand, ClearApiCacheDevCommand>();
```
However, to improve the application code's readability, it's better to define the registration as an extention method as demonstrated below:
```csharp
public static class DatabaseClearCacheExtensions
{
    public static DevCommandsOptions AddClearDatabaseCache(this DevCommandsOptions @this)
    {
        @this.Services.AddSingleton<IDevCommand, ClearApiCacheDevCommand>();
        return @this;
    }
}
```
That way, the end user's application can register your command along with all other commands, similar to:
```
if (Environment.IsDevelopment())
    services.AddDevCommands(x => x.AddCommandX().AddCommandY()...AddClearDatabaseCache());
```


## Invoking a Dev Command
To invoke a dev command a http request should be sent to the application with the url of `/cmd/{Name}`.

If the Dev Command implementation provides a non-empty value for the `Title` property, then a UI will be generated to invoke this command on the web pages. Basically, a link will be added for every such command currently registered in the application into a box called the **DevCommandsWidget**.

To enable the UI in your application, add `@Html.DevCommandsWidget()` right before `</main>` in your `Views/Layouts/***.cshtml` files.


## Built-in olive commands

The following are some of the built-in Olive commands. Some of them are used by automated UI testing tools, such as Pangolin or Sanity.
Some of the other ones are available for developers to invoke manually when required.

| Command     | Notes |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `db-clear-cache` | Simply calls `Database.Refresh()`. |
| `api-clear-cache` | A part of `Olive.ApiClient` plugin. When invoked, it clears all cached Api call responses. |
| `outbox`  | A part of `Olive.Email` plugin. When invoked, it will render a table with all generated emails message records in the database. It's useful in automated UI tests, to verify whether the application generated notification emails are working correctly. |
| `scheduled-tasks` |  A part of `Olive.Hangfire` plugin. Renders the status of all currently running scheduled tasks. |
| `db-get-changes` | Renders all non-query sql commands submitted to the database since the application started running. |
| `run-db-changes` | Executes a set of sql commands provided in the http request form value of `Data`. |
| `db-profile-start` | Starts measureing all sql query commands submitted to the database. |
| `db-profile-snapshot` | Generates a snapshot report of the profiling data so far, but keeps profiling. |
| `db-profile-stop` | Generates a snapshot report of the profiling data and stops profiling. |
| `db-restart` | Recreates the database from the sql script files in the `DB` folder. |
| `local-date?date=22/10/2020` | Overrides the application's local date to the specified value. It will affect `LocalTime.Now` rather than `DateTime.Now`. |
| `local-date?time=10:22:00` | Overrides the application's local time to the specified value.  |
| `local-date?date=now` | Resets the application's local time to the real value. |
| `test-context?name=MyTestName` | Sets the currently running UI Test name, which is used in `PredictableGuidGenerator` |

If you can think of any commands that developers would find useful during development and debugging of an application, feel free to submit your pull request for adding to Olive.
