# Docker support

We offer Docker support for Olive Microservice solution. Why? Because it's much easier to develop, run and maintain! It fixes the most common developer issue: "*It does not work in my machine*".  And so much other benefits that might come to your mind. If you have questions about Docker containers and Docker usage in microservice architecture, [HERE](http://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/) and [HERE](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/02/microservices-and-docker-containers-architecture-patterns-and-development-guidance/) are good ones to get started.

## How it works

Easily! We put every microservice and other required services (Such as database engine) in separate Docker containers.

## Getting Docker ready

First you need to install Docker and Docker toolbox in your machine. You can get Docker Docker toolbox from [HERE](https://www.docker.com/get-docker). You can install them in Linux and Windows 10 (Anniversary update or later). But it can't be installed in Windows server 2016.

> Please note that Hyper-V and Visualization feature should be enabled before docker installation.

### Installation in Windows server 2016

Docker and container is supported in Windows server 2016. But just windows containers. Here's instructions to add Linux Docker support to Windows server 2016.

1- Open up PowerShell as administrator and run `Install-WindowsFeature hyper-v,containers` command, then restart the machine. Make sure that Hyper-V feature is enabled.

2-Swich to your Windows 10 computer, Download "Docker for Windows" : [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

3-Copy `C:\Program Files\Docker` from the Windows 10 machine to `C:\Program Files\Docker` on your Server 2016.

4- Switch to Windows Server 2016, then import these registry settings:

```
---START---
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Docker Inc.\Docker]

---END---
```

5- Restart the computer and run the PowerShell script `'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\MobyLinux.ps1' -create`

6- Go to `C:\Program Files\Docker\` and run `Docker for Windows.exe`.

## After installation

In order to test your docker functionality you can open powershell and run `docker run hello-world`. if your docker is installed successfully it should downloads the image using internet and shows following message:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```
Docker on windows supports both windows image and linux image and you can switch between them. In order to do that, you can right click the Docker tasktray icon and choose *Switch to Linux/Windows Containers...*.

## Running dockerized microservices

First change the connection string of website project to
`Database=YourDatabaseName;Server=sql.data;User Id=sa;Password=Pass@word;Persist Security Info=False;MultipleActiveResultSets=True` 
Which can be found in *appsettings.json* file.

Then go to the solution, select `Docker Compose` as start-up project. Then press f5 and run the solution!
