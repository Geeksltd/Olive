We'll review your code ASAP and we will do the merge if everything was just fine. If there was any kind of issues, please post it in the [issues](https://github.com/Geeksltd/Olive/issues) section.

### Build and running the code

#### Prerequisites

1. Windows 10
2. Visual Studio 2017 (latest build) with .NET Core and web development features installed.
3. GIT for Windows ([install from here](http://gitforwindows.org/))

#### Next steps

Olive projects might have dependencies to each other. You might need to build other projects recursively to run a certain project. All projects have dependencies to **Olive** project; So you need to build this one first.
Also you can run **BuildAll.bat**, which is located in the root of the project, to build all of the Olive projects.
